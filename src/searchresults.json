His aim was to take stock of the nation's public face and private parts (as it were), and to analyse what precisely it was he loved so much about a country that had produced Marmite; a military hero whose dying wish was to be kissed by a fellow named Hardy; place names like Farleigh Wallop, Titsey and Shellow Bowells; people who said 'Mustn't grumble', and 'Ooh lovely' at the sight of a cup of tea and a plate of biscuits; and Gardeners' Question Time.

Others think it all started with his discovery, at the age of six, of a woollen jersey of rare fineness. Across the moth-holed chest was a golden thunderbolt. It may have looked like an old college football sweater, but young Bryson knew better. It was obviously the Sacred Jersey of Zap, and proved that he had been placed with this innocuous family in the middle of America to fly, become invisible, shoot guns out of people's hands from a distance, and wear his underpants over his jeans in the manner of Superman. Bill Bryson's first travel book opened with the immortal line, 'I come from Des Moines. Somebody had to.' In his deeply funny new memoir, he travels back in time to explore the ordinary kid he once was, and the curious world of 1950s America. It was a happy time, when almost everything was good for you, including DDT, cigarettes and nuclear fallout. This is a book about growing up in a specific time and place. But in Bryson's hands, it becomes everyone's story, one that will speak volumes - especially to anyone who has ever been young.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780552772549"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0552772542"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":403,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Travel writers"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":149,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.12.6.0.preview.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ORFLrYs-rWAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ORFLrYs-rWAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ORFLrYs-rWAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=bill+byrson&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ORFLrYs-rWAC&dq=bill+byrson&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Life_and_Times_of_the_Thunderbolt_Ki.html?hl=&id=ORFLrYs-rWAC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ORFLrYs-rWAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"It was a happy time, when almost everything was good for you, including DDT, cigarettes and nuclear fallout.
