Goulding"],"publisher":"Ballantine Books","publishedDate":"2011-03-16","description":"MAKE A SOUND INVESTMENT IN CLASSICAL MUSIC Who are the ten most important classical composers? Who in the world was Palestrina? Why did Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring\" cause a riot? Which five of each important composer's works should you buy? What is a concerto and how does it differ from a sonata? Maybe you don't know the answers to these questions; author Phil Goulding certainly didn't. When Goulding first tried to learn about classical music, he found himself buried in an avalanche of technical terms and complicated jargon--so he decided to write the book he couldn't find. The result is a complete classical music education in one volume. Comprehensive, discriminating, and delightfully irreverent, Classical Music provides such essential information as: * Rankings of the top 50 composers (Bach is #1. Borodin is #50) * A detailed and anecdotal look at each composer's life and work * The five primary works of each composer and specific recommended CDs for each. * Further great works of each composer--if you really like him * Concise explanations of musical terminology, forms, and periods * A guide to the parts and history of the symphony orchestra \"This book uses every conceivable gimmick to immerse readers in the richness of classical music: lists, rankings, sidebars devoted to lively anecdotes, and catchy leads.\" --The Washington Post \"One terrific music appreciation book...The information is surprisingly detailed but concisely presented. Goulding's writing style is breezy yet mature....[He] has raised music appreciation from a racket to a service.\" --The Arizona Daily Star","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780307760463"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0307760464"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":656,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Music"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":3,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"3.5.4.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vGLL4fEE08sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vGLL4fEE08sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=vGLL4fEE08sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=classical&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vGLL4fEE08sC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vGLL4fEE08sC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":27.15,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":15.31,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vGLL4fEE08sC&rdid=book-vGLL4fEE08sC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":27150000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":15310000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/Classical_Music-sample-epub.acsm?id=vGLL4fEE08sC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vGLL4fEE08sC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Borodin is #50) * A detailed and anecdotal look at each composer&#39;s life and work * The five primary works of each composer and specific recommended CDs for each. * Further great works of each composer--if you really like him * Concise ..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"ayT5T59ckzIC","etag":"xU88OqSuzVY","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ayT5T59ckzIC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Classical Music","subtitle":"The Listener's Companion","authors":["Alexander J.
