Kirkus 'Hilarious, vulgar, and immensely thought-provoking. Only read if you're willing to set aside all excuses and take an active role in living a f*cking better life.' Steve Kamb, bestselling author of Level Up Your Life and founder of nerdfitness.com EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN TOLD ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE OUR LIVES IS WRONG. NOW SUPERSTAR BLOGGER MARK MANSON TELLS US WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO GET IT RIGHT. For decades, we've been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. Drawing on academic research and the life experience that comes from breaking the rules, Mark Manson is ready to explode that myth. The key to a good life, according to Manson, is the understanding that 'sometimes shit is f*cked up and we have to live with it.' Manson says that instead of trying to turn lemons into lemonade, we should learn to stomach lemons better, and stop distracting ourselves from life's inevitable disappointments chasing 'shit' like money, success and possessions. It's time to re-calibrate our values and what it means to be happy: there are only so many things we can give a f*ck about, he says, so we need to figure out which ones really matter. From the writer whose blog draws two million readers a month and filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humour, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a welcome antidote to the 'let's-all-feel-good' mindset that has infected modern society.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781925483857"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1925483851"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Self-Help"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.5.6.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sTKxDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sTKxDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=sTKxDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+subtle+ark+of+not+giving+a+fuck&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sTKxDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sTKxDAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":16.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":16.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sTKxDAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-sTKxDAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":16990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":16990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/The_Subtle_Art_of_Not_Giving_a_F_ck-sample-epub.acsm?id=sTKxDAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/The_Subtle_Art_of_Not_Giving_a_F_ck-sample-pdf.acsm?id=sTKxDAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=sTKxDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"&#39; Steve Kamb, bestselling author of Level Up Your Life and founder of nerdfitness.com EVERYTHING WE&#39;VE BEEN TOLD ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE OUR LIVES IS WRONG.

International bestseller, 'The Happiness Trap', has been published in over thirty countries and twenty-two languages. NOW UPDATED. Popular ideas about happiness are misleading, inaccurate, and are directly contributing to our current epidemic of stress, anxiety and depression. And unfortunately, popular psychological approaches are making it even worse! In this easy-to-read, practical and empowering self-help book, Dr Russ Harries, reveals how millions of people are unwittingly caught in the 'The Happiness Trap', where the more they strive for happiness the more they suffer in the long term. He then provides an effective means to escape through the insights and techniques of ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), a groundbreaking new approach based on mindfulness skills. By clarifying your values and developing mindfulness (a technique for living fully in the present moment), ACT helps you escape the happiness trap and find true satisfaction in life. Mindfulness skills are easy to learn and will rapidly and effectively help you to reduce stress, enhance performance, manage emotions, improve health, increase vitality, and generally change your life for the better. The book provides scientifically proven techniques to: reduce stress and worry; rise above fear, doubt and insecurity; handle painful thoughts and feelings far more effectively; break self-defeating habits; improve performance and find fulfilment in your work; build more satisfying relationships; and, create a rich, full and meaningful life.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781921966347"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1921966343"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":284,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":2,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.2.2.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wPHRP1ObMMoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wPHRP1ObMMoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=wPHRP1ObMMoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+subtle+ark+of+not+giving+a+fuck&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wPHRP1ObMMoC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wPHRP1ObMMoC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":9.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wPHRP1ObMMoC&rdid=book-wPHRP1ObMMoC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":9990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/The_Happiness_Trap-sample-epub.acsm?id=wPHRP1ObMMoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=wPHRP1ObMMoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The book provides scientifically proven techniques to: reduce stress and worry; rise above fear, doubt and insecurity; handle painful thoughts and feelings far more effectively; break self-defeating habits; improve performance and find ..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"MTg1DwAAQBAJ","etag":"5CuFPhwYDaw","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/MTg1DwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Models","subtitle":"Attract Women Through Honesty","authors":["Mark Manson"],"publisher":"Pan Australia","publishedDate":"2017-09-11","description":"\"You can become irresistibly attractive to women without changing who you are.\" So says Mark Manson, superstar blogger and author of the international bestseller, The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a self help book that packs a punch. Mark brings the same approach to teaching men what they need to know about attracting women. In Models he shows us how much it sucks trying to attract women using the tricks and tactics recommended by other books. Instead, he says, men need to focus on seduction as an emotional process not a physical or social one. What matters is the intention, the motivation, the authenticity. To improve your dating life you must improve your emotional life - how you feel about yourself and how you express yourself to others.
