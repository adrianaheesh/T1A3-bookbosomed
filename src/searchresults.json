A Short History of Nearly Everything is his quest to understand everything that has happened from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization - how we got from there, being nothing at all, to here, being us. Bill Bryson's challenge is to take subjects that normally bore the pants off most of us, like geology, chemistry and particle physics, and see if there isn't some way to render them comprehensible to people who have never thought they could be interested in science. The ultimate eye-opening journey through time and space, A Short History of Nearly Everything is the biggest-selling popular science book of the 21st century, and reveals the world in a way most of us have never seen it before.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781409095484"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1409095487"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":672,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Science"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":3469,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"2.11.10.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m3Yfj-KWgCEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m3Yfj-KWgCEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=m3Yfj-KWgCEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=bill+bryson&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m3Yfj-KWgCEC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m3Yfj-KWgCEC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":4.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":4.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m3Yfj-KWgCEC&rdid=book-m3Yfj-KWgCEC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":4990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":4990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything-sample-epub.acsm?id=m3Yfj-KWgCEC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=m3Yfj-KWgCEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Bill Bryson describes himself as a reluctant traveller, but even when he stays safely at home he can&#39;t contain his curiosity about the world around him."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"w1-9sLMpA0IC","etag":"U/GkDsn0XRk","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/w1-9sLMpA0IC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Bill Bryson the Complete Notes","authors":["Bill Bryson"],"publisher":"Random House","publishedDate":"2010-12-01","description":"After nearly two decades in Britain, when Bryson took the decision to move Mrs Bryson, little Jimmy et al. back to the States, he made one last valedictory tour around old Blighty, resulting in Notes from a Small Island, a heartfelt eulogy to the country that produced Marmite, milky tea, Gardeners' Question Time and people who say, 'Mustn't grumble'.
