I am so ready for myself after reading this book!' Adele 'Untamed will liberate women - emotionally, spiritually, and physically. It is phenomenal.' Elizabeth Gilbert, author of City of Girls and Eat Pray Love Who were you before the world told you who to be? Part inspiration, part memoir, Untamed explores the joy and peace we discover when we stop striving to meet the expectations of the world, and instead dare to listen to and trust in the voice deep inside us. From the beloved New York Times bestselling author, speaker and activist Glennon Doyle. ***** For many years, Glennon Doyle denied her discontent. Then, while speaking at a conference, she looked at a woman across the room and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: There. She. Is. At first, Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high but soon she realised they had come to her from within. This was the voice she had buried beneath decades of numbing addictions and social conditioning. Glennon decided to let go of the world's expectations of her and reclaim her true untamed self. Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, Untamed is both an intimate memoir and a galvanising wake-up call. It is the story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is also the story of how each of us can begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make peace with our bodies, honour our anger and heartbreak, and unleash our truest, wildest instincts. Untamed shows us how to be brave. And, as Glennon insists, 'The braver we are, the luckier we get.'","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781473580909"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1473580900"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":352,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":3,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.5.5.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qqvBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qqvBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=qqvBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=book&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qqvBDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qqvBDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qqvBDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-qqvBDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/Untamed-sample-epub.acsm?id=qqvBDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=qqvBDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"&#39;This book will shake your brain and make your soul scream.

A CNN Book of the Week: “Explains not just why we should read books, but how we should read them. It's masterfully done.” –Farheed Zakaria Originally published in 1940, this book is a rare phenomenon, a living classic that introduces and elucidates the various levels of reading and how to achieve them—from elementary reading, through systematic skimming and inspectional reading, to speed reading. Readers will learn when and how to “judge a book by its cover,” and also how to X-ray it, read critically, and extract the author’s message from the text. Also included is instruction in the different techniques that work best for reading particular genres, such as practical books, imaginative literature, plays, poetry, history, science and mathematics, philosophy and social science works. Finally, the authors offer a recommended reading list and supply reading tests you can use measure your own progress in reading skills, comprehension, and speed.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1439144834"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781439144831"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":426,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Language Arts & Disciplines"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":75,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.19.15.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z5PpkQadm5EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z5PpkQadm5EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Z5PpkQadm5EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=book&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z5PpkQadm5EC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z5PpkQadm5EC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":4.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":4.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z5PpkQadm5EC&rdid=book-Z5PpkQadm5EC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":4990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":4990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/How_to_Read_a_Book-sample-epub.acsm?id=Z5PpkQadm5EC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Z5PpkQadm5EC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"It&#39;s masterfully done.” –Farheed Zakaria Originally published in 1940, this book is a rare phenomenon, a living classic that introduces and elucidates the various levels of reading and how to achieve them—from elementary reading, ..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"YY4EAAAAYAAJ","etag":"O5lgpUJafS8","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/YY4EAAAAYAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Origin of Species","authors":["Charles Darwin"],"publishedDate":"1909","description":"First published in 1859, this landmark book on evolutionary biology was not the first to deal with the subject, but it went on to become a sensation—and a controversial one for many religious people who could not reconcile Darwin’s science with their faith.
