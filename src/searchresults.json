Shy, introspective, intelligent beyond his years, caught between trying to live his life and trying to run from it, Charlie is attempting to navigate through the uncharted territory of high school. The world of first dates and mixed tapes, family dramas and new friends. The world of sex, drugs, and music - when all one requires to feel infinite is that perfect song on that perfect drive. Standing on the fringes of life Charlie has a unique perspective of the world around him, but there comes a time to stop being a wallflower and see what it looks like from the dance floor. This haunting novel about the dilemma of passivity vs. passion has become a modern classic. Charlie's letters are singular and unique, hilarious and devastating and through Charlie, Stephen Chbosky has created a deeply affecting story that will spirit you back to those wild and poignant roller coaster days known as growing up.

The realistic portrayal of these controversial topics led to complaints from parents - namely, that the novel's content is unsuitable for their children. The novel was challenged and banned repeatedly from schools and libraries in America, which means that it was no longer available for students to read. Some call this prohibition of the novel within schools censorship, which has sparked much debate on whether one individual complaining about a book has the right to determine what all students can or cannot read in school. This thesis takes into account and analyses opinions of parents, teachers, teenagers, the author of the novel Stephen Chbosky and some organisations involved in the fight for or against the banning of the novel. Since The Perks of Being a Wallflower is not as well-known in Slovenia as it is in America, Andrej Predin's novel Na zeleno vejo is referred to in order to see how people in Slovenia reacted to a similarly controversial novel.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"OTHER","identifier":"OCLC:965921292"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":65,"printType":"BOOK","averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=bZ5CAQAACAAJ&dq=perks+of+being+a+wallflower&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=bZ5CAQAACAAJ&dq=perks+of+being+a+wallflower&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Taboo_Topics_in_Stephen_Chbosky_s_The_Pe.html?hl=&id=bZ5CAQAACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=bZ5CAQAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The novel was challenged and banned repeatedly from schools and libraries in America, which means that it was no longer available for students to read."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"uz0ODQAAQBAJ","etag":"WPu3r4Zydfo","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/uz0ODQAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Perks of Being a Wallflower: A Novel by Stephen Chbosky (Trivia-On-Books)","authors":["Trivion Books"],"publisher":"","publishedDate":"2016-09-13","description":"Trivia-on-Book: The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky Take the challenge yourself and share it with friends and family for a time of fun!
