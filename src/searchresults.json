But the more fame this and her other books encouraged, the more reclusive Daphne du Maurier became. Margaret Forster's award-winning biography could hardly be more worthy of its subject. Drawing on private letters and papers, and with the unflinching co-operation of Daphne du Maurier's family, Margaret Forster explores the secret drama of her life - the stifling relationship with her father, actor-manager Gerald du Maurier; her troubled marriage to war hero and royal aide, 'Boy' Browning; her wartime love affair; her passion for Cornwall and her deep friendships with the last of her father's actress loves, Gertrude Lawrence, and with an aristocratic American woman. Most significant of all, Margaret Forster ingeniously strips away the relaxed and charming facade to lay bare the true workings of a complex and emotional character whose passionate and often violent stories mirrored her own fantasy life more than anyone could ever have imagined.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781446455609"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1446455602"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":480,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":5,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"0.6.5.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yZ3hQPo0bAgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yZ3hQPo0bAgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=yZ3hQPo0bAgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=daphne+maurier&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yZ3hQPo0bAgC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yZ3hQPo0bAgC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":14.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yZ3hQPo0bAgC&rdid=book-yZ3hQPo0bAgC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":14990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/Daphne_Du_Maurier-sample-epub.acsm?id=yZ3hQPo0bAgC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=yZ3hQPo0bAgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Du Maurier was immediately established as the queen of the psychological thriller.

However, the trope of the double has far more potential than just sending shivers down our spines; its appearance might indeed raise, and confront us with, important questions concerning our own identity and subjectivity. I would like to exemplify this by comparing the importance of doppelgänger figures in Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca and Angela Carter’s The Magic Toyshop in relation to gender identity and would like to investigate, in particular, how the trope of the double/phantom might call into question gender role expectations, shed light on their constructedness, and ultimately play an important role in overcoming social and sexual limitations.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9783656675433"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"3656675430"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":8,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Literary Criticism"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.3.0.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z4nYAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z4nYAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Z4nYAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=daphne+maurier&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z4nYAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z4nYAwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":4.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":4.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z4nYAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Z4nYAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":4990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":4990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/The_Double_in_Daphne_Maurier_s_Rebecca_a-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Z4nYAwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Z4nYAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The trope of the double in <b>Daphne Maurier&#39;s</b> Rebecca and Angela Carter&#39;s The <br>\nMagic Toyshop And in the mirror, I can no longer tell whether I am still myself, or <br>\njust something she&#39;s created[.] (Wyrick, 1996: 21) Doubling is the “appearance of<br>\n&nbsp;..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"Qk3S1OUlT4cC","etag":"i5a79li/zyU","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Qk3S1OUlT4cC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Mary Anne","authors":["Daphne Du Maurier"],"publisher":"Hachette UK","publishedDate":"2012-06-07","description":"'Like its heroine the book is possessed of such unforgettably vivid charm that one is seduced' L.

So when Mary Anne Clarke seeks an escape from her squalid surroundings in Bowling Inn Alley, she ventures first into the scurrilous world of the pamphleteers. Her personal charms are such, however, that before long she comes to the notice of the Duke of York. With her taste for luxury and power, Mary Anne, now a royal mistress, must aim higher. Her lofty connections allow her to establish a thriving trade in military commissions, provoking a scandal that rocks the government - and brings personal disgrace.
