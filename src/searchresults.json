Rowling, John Tiffany, and Jack Thorne, a play by Jack Thorne. It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn't much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father of three school-age children. While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son, Albus, must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: Sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places. The playscript for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was originally released as a \"special rehearsal edition\" alongside the opening of Jack Thorne's play in London's West End in summer 2016. Based on an original story by J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany, and Jack Thorne, the play opened to rapturous reviews from theatergoers and critics alike, while the official playscript became an immediate global bestseller. This revised edition updates the \"special rehearsal edition\" with the conclusive and final dialogue from the play, which has subtly changed since its rehearsals, as well as a conversation piece between director John Tiffany and writer Jack Thorne, who share stories and insights about reading playscripts. This edition also includes useful background information including the Potter family tree and a timeline of events from the wizarding world prior to the beginning of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1338216678"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781338216677"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":336,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Juvenile Nonfiction"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":178,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2BMDuAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2BMDuAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=2BMDuAEACAAJ&dq=harry+potter&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=2BMDuAEACAAJ&dq=harry+potter&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Harry_Potter_and_the_Cursed_Child.html?hl=&id=2BMDuAEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2BMDuAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Harry Potter, now an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic and father of three, watches as his youngest son struggles with the family legacy.

The collection's three sections address broad issues related to genre, Harry Potter's development as the central heroic character and the question of who qualifies as a hero in the Harry Potter series. Among the topics are Harry Potter as both epic and postmodern hero, the series as a modern-day example of psychomachia, the series' indebtedness to the Gothic tradition, Harry's development in the first six film adaptations, Harry Potter and the idea of the English gentleman, Hermione Granger's explicitly female version of heroism, adult role models in Harry Potter, and the complex depictions of heroism exhibited by the series' minor characters. Together, the essays suggest that the Harry Potter novels rely on established generic, moral and popular codes to develop new and genuine ways of expressing what a globalized world has applauded as ethically exemplary models of heroism based on responsibility, courage, humility and kindness.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781409478416"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1409478416"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":248,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Literary Criticism"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.4.3.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o-QCOFDHmPEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o-QCOFDHmPEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=o-QCOFDHmPEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=harry+potter&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=o-QCOFDHmPEC&dq=harry+potter&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Heroism_in_the_Harry_Potter_Series.html?hl=&id=o-QCOFDHmPEC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/Heroism_in_the_Harry_Potter_Series-sample-epub.acsm?id=o-QCOFDHmPEC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/Heroism_in_the_Harry_Potter_Series-sample-pdf.acsm?id=o-QCOFDHmPEC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=o-QCOFDHmPEC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Taking up the various conceptions of heroism that are conjured in the Harry Potter series, this collection examines the ways fictional heroism in the twenty-first century challenges the idealized forms of a somewhat simplistic masculinity ..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"JGQBcu5O_ZcC","etag":"FZLf2EVh7R8","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/JGQBcu5O_ZcC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Friends and Foes of Harry Potter","subtitle":"Names Decoded","authors":["Nikita Agarwal","Chitra Agarwal","Benjamin Vincent"],"publisher":"Texas World Publishing","publishedDate":"2005","description":"Examines the meanings behind the names of people and places in the Harry Potter books.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781598002218"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"159800221X"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":159,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Juvenile Nonfiction"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":2,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.1.0.0.preview.1","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JGQBcu5O_ZcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JGQBcu5O_ZcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=JGQBcu5O_ZcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=harry+potter&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=JGQBcu5O_ZcC&dq=harry+potter&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Friends_and_Foes_of_Harry_Potter.html?hl=&id=JGQBcu5O_ZcC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JGQBcu5O_ZcC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Examines the meanings behind the names of people and places in the Harry Potter books."}}]}
