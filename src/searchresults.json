A college student in Dublin and aspiring writer, she works at a literary agency by day. At night, she performs spoken word with her best friend Bobbi, who used to be her girlfriend. When they are profiled by Melissa, a well-known journalist, they enter an exotic orbit of beautiful houses, raucous dinner parties and holidays in Provence. Initially unimpressed, Frances finds herself embroiled in a risky m√©nage a quatre when she begins an affair with Nick, Melissa's actor husband. Desperate to reconcile herself to the desires and vulnerabilities of her body, Frances's intellectual certainties begin to yield to something new - a painful and disorienting way of living from moment to moment. But as Frances tries to keep control, her relationships increasingly unspool: with Nick, with her difficult and unhappy father, and finally even with Bobbi. Written with rare precision and probing intelligence, Conversations with Friends is exquisitely alive to the pleasures and inhibitions of youth.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780571333141"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0571333141"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":272,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":47,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.6.5.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WbtvDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WbtvDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=WbtvDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=sally+roony&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WbtvDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WbtvDgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":10.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":10.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WbtvDgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-WbtvDgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":10990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":10990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/Conversations_with_Friends-sample-epub.acsm?id=WbtvDgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/Conversations_with_Friends-sample-pdf.acsm?id=WbtvDgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WbtvDgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"FROM THE AUTHOR OF NORMAL PEOPLE - ADAPTED FOR A BBC THREE DRAMA, PREMIERING ON APRIL 26, 2020 &#39;This book.

Years ago, Sukie moved in with Nathan because her mother was dead and her father was difficult, and she had nowhere else to go. Now they are on the brink of the inevitable. Sally Rooney is one of the most acclaimed young talents of recent years. With her minute attention to the power dynamics in everyday speech, she builds up sexual tension and throws a deceptively low-key glance at love and death.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780571354641"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0571354645"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":48,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.1.1.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-uB_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-uB_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=-uB_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=sally+roony&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-uB_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-uB_DwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":2.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":2.99,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-uB_DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book--uB_DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":2990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":2990000,"currencyCode":"AUD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/Mr_Salary-sample-epub.acsm?id=-uB_DwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/Mr_Salary-sample-pdf.acsm?id=-uB_DwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-uB_DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"HlFuDwAAQBAJ","etag":"bcnBuu67kE4","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/HlFuDwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"A Diary from Dixie","authors":["Mary Boykin Miller Chesnut"],"publisher":"Strelbytskyy Multimedia Publishing","publishedDate":"2018-09-05","description":"A Diary from Dixie is a book by an American writer, who was born in a famous slave-owning state, South Caroline, Mary Boykin Chesnut.

Some of his most-important achievements, however, took place off the playing field as he sought to bring about equity in the league's hiring practices and peace in his ancestral homeland of Ireland. As a business leader, a philanthropist, a diplomat and the author of the famous Rooney Rule, Dan Rooney was known for his core values, his quiet strength, his effectiveness, and his willingness to talk to and hear from those who disagreed with him. In this poignant account of his father's life, Jim Rooney takes readers behind the scenes to share stories from his hundreds of hours of interviews with business and political leaders; sports and celebrity influencers; and family members. Part memoir, part business biography, part history book, A Different Way to Win underscores the importance of focusing on the long game and the effectiveness in building consensus in a way that is meaningful and sustainable for decades to come.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1733404910"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781733404914"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":218,"printType":"BOOK","maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HOqUygEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HOqUygEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=HOqUygEACAAJ&dq=sally+roony&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=HOqUygEACAAJ&dq=sally+roony&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Different_Way_to_Win.html?hl=&id=HOqUygEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=HOqUygEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Part memoir, part business biography, part history book, A Different Way to Win underscores the importance of focusing on the long game and the effectiveness in building consensus in a way that is meaningful and sustainable for decades to ..."}}]}
