In the Break is an extended riff on \"The Burton Greene Affair, \" exploring the tangled relationship between black avant-grade in music and literature in the 1950s and 1960s, the emergence of a distinct form of black cultural nationalism, and the complex engagement with and disavowal of homoeroticism that bridges the two. Fred Moten focuses in particular on the brilliant improvisatory jazz of John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, Eric Dolphy, Charles Mingus, and others, arguing that all black performance--culture, politics, sexuality, identity, and blackness itself--is improvisation. For Moten, improvisation provides a unique epistemological standpoint from which to investigate the provocative connections between black aesthetics and Western philosophy. He engages in a strenuous critical analysis of Western philosophy (Heidegger, Kant, Husserl, Wittgenstein, and Derrida) through the prism of radical black thought and culture. As the critical, lyrical, and disruptive performance of the human, Moten's concept of blackness also brings such figures as Frederick Douglass and Karl Marx, Cecil Taylor and Samuel R. Delany, Billie Holiday and William Shakespeare into conversation with each other. Stylistically brilliant and challenging, much like the music he writes about, Moten's wide-ranging discussion embraces a variety of disciplines--semiotics, deconstruction, genre theory, social history, and psychoanalysis--to understand thepoliticized sexuality, particularly homoeroticism, underpinning black radicalism. In the Break is the inaugural volume in Moten's ambitious intellectual project--to establish an aesthetic genealogy of the black radical tradition.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0816640998"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780816640997"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":315,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Social Science"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.0.1.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eclwFpG0xggC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eclwFpG0xggC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=eclwFpG0xggC&printsec=frontcover&dq=break&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=eclwFpG0xggC&dq=break&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/In_the_Break.html?hl=&id=eclwFpG0xggC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/In_the_Break-sample-epub.acsm?id=eclwFpG0xggC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books/download/In_the_Break-sample-pdf.acsm?id=eclwFpG0xggC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eclwFpG0xggC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In the Break is the inaugural volume in Moten&#39;s ambitious intellectual project--to establish an aesthetic genealogy of the black radical tradition."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"i52ZDgAAQBAJ","etag":"gDSdxrbG+cQ","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/i52ZDgAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Break","subtitle":"The powerful tale of love, loss and violence, endorsed by Margaret Atwood","authors":["Katherena Vermette"],"publisher":"Atlantic Books","publishedDate":"2017-07-06","description":"Longlisted for the Dublin Literary Award 2018 Crime Book of the Month, Sunday Times, February 2018 'A tough, close-up look at a side of female life that's often hard to acknowledge: the violence girls and women sometimes display towards other girls and women ... An accomplished writer who will go far.' - Margaret Atwood Stella, a young Métis mother, lives with her family by the Break, an isolated strip of land on the edge of their small Canadian town. Glancing out of her window one winter's evening Stella spots someone in trouble; horrified, she calls the police. But when they arrive, no one is there, scuff marks in the compacted snow the only sign anything may have happened. What follows is a heartbreaking and powerful tale of a community in crisis as the people connected to the victim, a young girl on the edge of a precipice, begin to lay bare their stories leading up to that fateful night. From Lou, a social worker grappling with the end of a relationship, to Cheryl, an artist mourning the premature death of her sister. And from Phoenix, a homeless teenager released from a youth detention centre with no one to turn to, to Officer Scott, a Métis policeman caught between two worlds. Through the prism of one extended, intergenerational family, Vermette's urgent story shines a light on the power, violence and love shared between women of all cultures, creeds and ages.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781786493903"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"178649390X"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":15,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.6.6.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i52ZDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i52ZDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=i52ZDgAAQBAJ&dq=break&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=i52ZDgAAQBAJ&dq=break&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Break.html?hl=&id=i52ZDgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"AU","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"AU","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=i52ZDgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"An accomplished writer who will go far.&#39; - Margaret Atwood Stella, a young Métis mother, lives with her family by the Break, an isolated strip of land on the edge of their small Canadian town."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"CrxPDgAAQBAJ","etag":"5Zf1X1EfR8s","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/CrxPDgAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Break","authors":["Marian Keyes"],"publisher":"Penguin UK","publishedDate":"2017-09-07","description":"THE SUNDAY TIMES NUMBER ONE BESTSELLER FROM THE BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF GROWN UPS, MARIAN KEYES 'JUST BRILLIANT' SUNDAY TIMES ___________ 'Myself and Hugh . . .
